# Tables

# Formulation

Static variables

$D = d_{x}$

* The due date of job $x$
    * $D = [28,35,24,32,30,40]$
    
$P = p_{x}$

* The time to process job $x$
    * $P = [5,7,9,11,13,15]$

Descision variables

$X = x_{1}, x_{2}, ... x_{6}$

* $x_{i}$ is the job number in position x.
    * Processing job 2 in position 4 would mean $x_{4} = 2$

Objective function

* Minimize: $\sum_{i=1}^{6}\max(0, \sum_{j=1}^{i}p_{x_{j}} - d_{x_{j}})$
  
Subject to

* All different $x_{i}$ 
* Bounds
     * $1 <= x_{i} <= 6$

# R translation

**Process**

* Clear everything
* Required packages
* Setup tables
* Add fitness function
    * `JDEoptim(...)` only supports real valued inputs. To _force_ some of those to be ints use `floor(...)` in the objective function
    * Test `fn(...)`
* Add in the constraints
    * All constraints should be re-written in the form of $f(x) = 0$ or $f(x) <= 0$
    * `JDEoptim(...)` only supports real valued inputs. To _force_ some of those to be ints use `floor(...)` in the objective function
    * In the case of straight `TRUE`/`FALSE` constraints like "All Different" return `-1` and make that an equality constraint. If you make it `+1`,this algorithm freaks out and stops. I don't know why.
    * Test `constr(...)`
* Add in bounds
* Use `tol = 0.000001`
    * The default tolarance is _too_ small for most cases
* Use `set.seed(...)`
    * This ensures predictable results when re-running.
* Solve
    * `JDEoptim(...)` only supports real valued inputs. To _allow_ some of those to be ints, use `(ub+1)`
    * `meq=1` forces the first $1$ results from `constr(...)` to be considered as $=0$ then the rest as $<=0$
    * `model$value` is the result of the objective function.
        * $Objective = 33$
    * `model$par` are the values of the desision variables that made the `model$value`
        * $X = [5,3,1,2,4,6]$
* Double check all constraints are meet

**R Results**

The minimum over due is $33$ using the sequence $X = [5,3,1,2,4,6]$ based on `model2`

* Other answers (i.e. the book's $X = [1,3,5,2,4,6]$) can the same _result_, just not a "better" result

**Book results**

Per page 347 "... producing the solution shown in Figure 12.10, with an objective function value of 33." [The sequence is $X = [1,3,5,2,4,6]]

```{r results="hold"}

  x = floor(x)
  
  len = length(x)
  pro = tab[1, x] # processing time re-ordered by sequence
  dro = tab[2, x] # due date re-ordered by sequence
