# Tables

|Job Number | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|

# Formulation

Static variables

$D = d_{x}$

* The due date of job $x$
    * $D = [28,35,24,32,30,40]$
    
$P = p_{x}$

* The time to process job $x$
    * $P = [5,7,9,11,13,15]$

Descision variables

$X = x_{1}, x_{2}, ... x_{6}$

* The job number in position x.
    * Processing job 2 in position 4 would mean $x_{4} = 2$

Objective function

* Minimize: $\sum_{i=1}^{6}\max(0, \sum_{j=1}^{i}p_{x_{i}} - d_{x_{i}})$
  
Subject to

* All different $j_{x}$ 

# R translation

**Process**

* Clear everything
* Required packages
* Setup tables
* Add fitness function
    * `genoud(...)` apperes to only allows for the notion of "fitness" and not constraints. So calculate the `objective`, then exaluate all the `constraints`. If any of the constraints are violated make the objective `204`
        * Objective Min should update the result to a large value
        * $204 = \max(D) + \sum_{x=1}^{6}\max(D)+\max(P)-\min(D)$
            * Don't start anything at all until the max due date has pased
            * Always assume the longest time
    * Test `fn(...)`
* Add in the Domain. The first column is the lower bound and the second column is the upper bound.
* Solve
    * When using a genetic algorithm solver, always do at least 2 starting positions. In-order (`1:6`) and reverse-order(`6:1`) seem like good bets.
    * Use `set.seed(...)` to get predictable results when re-running.
    * Use `data.type.int = TRUE` whenever posible else the GA will tend to return a float
    * Use `Domains` but **NOT** `boundary.enforcement=2`. This may seem counter intituive, but if the generation can't "grow" outside the space, it has a hard time aproaching the line.
    * Use `print.level = 0` because `genoud(...)` is _super_ chatty otherwise.
    * `$value`  is the result of the objective function.
    * `$par` are the values of the desision variables that made the `$value`

**R Results**

The minimum over due is $33$ using the sequence $X = [3,1,5,2,4,6]$ based on `model2`

* `model1` performs poorer($35$)
* Other answers (i.e. the books $X = [1,3,5,2,4,6]$) can produce a similar result

**Book results**

Per page 347 "... producing the solution shown in Figure 12.10, with an objective function value of 33." [The sequence is $X = [1,3,5,2,4,6]]

**Code**
```{r results="hold"}
rm(list = ls())
options(scipen = 999)
if (!require('rgenoud')) install.packages('rgenoud', quiet=TRUE)
library(rgenoud)
tab = matrix(c(5,7,9,11,13,15,28,35,24,32,30,40), nrow = 2, ncol = 6, byrow = TRUE)
fn = function(x) {
  
  len = length(x)
  pro = tab[1, x] # processing time re-ordered by sequence
  dro = tab[2, x] # due date re-ordered by sequence
  
  objective = 0
  for(i in 1:len) {
    objective = objective + max(0, sum(pro[1:i]) - dro[i])
  }
  
  if(length(unique(x)) != length(x))
    objective = 204

  return (objective)
}
fn(1:6) == 35
fn(c(1,2,3,4,5,5)) == 204
Domains = t(matrix(c(1,1,1,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,6,6), nrow = 2, ncol = 6, byrow = TRUE))
sp1 = 1:6
sp2 = 6:1
set.seed(1)
model1 = genoud(fn=fn, nvars=6, starting.values=sp1, Domains=Domains, print.level = 0, data.type.int = TRUE)
set.seed(1)
model2 = genoud(fn=fn, nvars=6, starting.values=sp2, Domains=Domains, print.level = 0, data.type.int = TRUE)
model1$value
model2$value
model1$par
